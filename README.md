## TRAVEL BUD
We're developing a group travel app where users can join or create travel groups. The app supports collaborative planning with itinerary and chat features. Users can track expenses, and cost allocations are based on their preferred group activities.

# Building of our app
We have used figma for webframing at first then later started working on flutter to develop the app.We have used Firebase for authentication and cloud storage of users data.
